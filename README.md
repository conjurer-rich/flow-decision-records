# Flow Decision Records (FDRs)

Flow Decision Records (FDRs) help teams and organizations capture and share key decisions that shape the flow of value.

Each FDR:

- Documents a decision made to improve flow
- Uses an advice process to gather input
- Is categorized as Now, Next, or Later in the roadmap
- Is evaluated over time for impact and learning
