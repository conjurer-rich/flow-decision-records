Supporting decentralized, transparent decisions that enable faster flow of value

## 1. What is a Flow Decision?

A Flow Decision is a deliberate, documented choice made to improve the flow of change or value within and across teams. Unlike traditional top-down decisions or untracked team-level adjustments, Flow Decisions are:

- Grounded in user needs and real-world context
- Made using a lightweight advice process
- Shared transparently using a Flow Decision Record (FDR)
- Reviewed and evolved over time—not set in stone

## 2. Why Flow Decisions Matter

In fast-moving organizations, decisions about team structures, boundaries, ownership, and responsibilities are often made informally—or not made at all. This leads to:

- Conflicting priorities
- Repeated work
- Missed user needs
- Friction between teams

Flow Decisions help by:

- Maximizing alignment without central control
- Reducing ambiguity in how we respond to user needs
- Increasing momentum by making structural evolution part of everyday work

## 3. When to Make a Flow Decision

Use a Flow Decision when you hit a structural friction point—a signal that flow is blocked or unclear. Common triggers include:

- Ownership is unclear across teams
- Work keeps bouncing between teams
- A team is trying to serve too many users
- One service has diverging or conflicting needs
- You’re considering splitting, combining, or changing team responsibilities

Ask yourself:

“Are we making a decision that affects how value flows across people, teams, or services?”

If yes—consider creating an FDR.

## 4. Anatomy of a Flow Decision Record (FDR)

Each FDR should be concise and structured for clarity and action. Here’s a basic format:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | A short, descriptive name |
| Context | What triggered this decision? What flow issues or needs are in play? |
| Decision | What are we trying, changing, or clarifying? |
| Advice Gathered | Who was consulted? What input did they offer? |
| Expected Impact | What will this decision change or enable? What risks exist? |
| Owner | Who is responsible for shepherding this change? |
| Start Date / Review Date | When will this be active? When will we review it? |
| Status | Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Implemented, Evaluated |

## 5. Making the Decision: Use the Advice Process

Flow Decisions are made with input, not by consensus.

Identify stakeholders: Who might be affected? Who has relevant expertise?

Seek advice early: Give people a chance to contribute insight or raise risks

Own the decision: The proposer decides, incorporating feedback transparently

This approach builds trust and speeds up progress—without falling into design-by-committee.

## 6. Communicating and Acting on the Decision

Once the FDR is finalized:

Share it visibly (e.g. FDR board, dashboard, Slack/Teams post)

Link it to your roadmap (Now–Next–Later)

Support the decision with necessary changes, such as:

- Reassigning responsibilities
- Adjusting team interactions
- Clarifying policies or agreements

## 7. Reviewing and Evolving FDRs

Each Flow Decision should be reviewed regularly:

- Has the expected impact been realized?
- Are the risks or trade-offs acceptable?
- Do we need to evolve, extend, or reverse the decision?

Build a cadence for reviewing active FDRs (e.g. monthly) and let teams reflect on what’s working.

## 8. Example FDR (Fictional)

Title: Split the Data Services Team into Two Stream-Aligned Teams
Context: Data Services team is overloaded, serving multiple business domains with competing priorities.
Decision: Split into two stream-aligned teams: one focused on Product Analytics, one on Operational Reporting.
Advice Gathered: Consulted domain leads and platform architect. Consensus that focus would improve responsiveness.
Expected Impact: Reduce delivery delays, clarify ownership, and improve domain-specific expertise.
Owner: Head of Data Engineering
Start Date / Review Date: April 15 / June 15
Status: Proposed

## 9. Start Small, Learn Fast

- Flow Decisions don’t need to be perfect—just intentional and transparent.
- Start with one or two real FDRs.
- Keep them lightweight
- Share and reflect openly
- Use each one to improve your playbook
