The **Flow Signals Radar** is a visual tool that helps teams evaluate and prioritize **Flow Decision Signals**. It enables structured conversation around **which signals to act on** and **when they should escalate into Flow Decision Triggers**.

## üß≠ What is it?

The radar plots **Flow Decision Signals** on two axes:

- **X-Axis: Number of People Affected**  
  - Left = Localized (1 team, 1 product area)  
  - Right = Widespread (multiple teams, critical path, broad user impact)

- **Y-Axis: Symptom vs Root Cause**  
  - Bottom = Root Cause (systemic issue driving other problems)  
  - Top = Symptom (surface-level effect, potentially caused by deeper issues)

---

## üß© What are we looking for?

The goal is to identify **which signals should become Flow Decision Triggers**‚Äîthose that warrant a structured decision.

These appear in the **bottom-right quadrant** of the radar:

‚úÖ **High impact, root cause signals**  
These are:

- Affecting many people or teams  
- Linked to recurring or critical flow issues  
- Foundational to resolving other struggles

These should prompt further investigation or lead directly to a **Flow Decision Record (FDR)**.

## üìâ How to use the radar

1. **Gather signals**  
   Collect blockers, tensions, or struggles during workshops, clinics, or interviews.

2. **Plot the signals**  
   For each signal, ask:
   - How many people or teams does this affect?
   - Is this the root cause of other issues or just a symptom?

   Place the signal accordingly on the radar.

3. **Discuss & Cluster**  
   Group similar signals. Look for patterns. Discuss dependencies between them.

4. **Identify Candidates for Action**  
   Prioritize signals in the **bottom-right quadrant** for flow decisions.
   Signals in the **top-right** may also warrant decisions if feasible.
   Signals in the **bottom-left** are often worth watching‚Äîthey may grow.

5. **Document Triggers**  
   When a signal becomes a trigger, document it as part of a Flow Decision Record.

## üìå Radar quadrant summary

| Quadrant | Characteristics | What to do |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| üîç **Top Left** | Local, symptomatic | Monitor. Often team-level. Not urgent. |
| üìà **Top Right** | Widespread, symptomatic | Investigate. Often highlight misaligned incentives or communication patterns. |
| üß± **Bottom Left** | Local, root cause | Track. Might become systemic over time. Useful for local experimentation. |
| üö® **Bottom Right** | Widespread, root cause | PRIORITIZE. Strong candidate for a Flow Decision Trigger. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical tips

- Use sticky notes or cards to place signals physically or digitally  
- Encourage teams to move signals as their understanding evolves  
- Run a **Radar Review** every 2‚Äì4 weeks to assess movement  
- Use color-coding to highlight categories (e.g., platform, ownership, feedback loops)

## üéØ From signal to decision

The radar doesn‚Äôt just help visualize‚Äîit helps reason.

> ‚ÄúThis signal keeps showing up in different teams‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs connected to several delivery delays. Let‚Äôs elevate it to a trigger.‚Äù

When you're ready:

- Draft a Flow Decision Record (FDR)
- Include the radar placement as part of its **Context**
- Track how the signal-to-trigger path supports prioritization

Next, evaluate whether the signal should [Trigger a Flow Decision Record](/docs/flow-decision-triggers).
