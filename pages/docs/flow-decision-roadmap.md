The Flow Decision Roadmap is a living artifact that helps you **sequence the changes** needed to improve flow, guided by real signals—not guesses or top-down plans.

Unlike traditional project roadmaps, the Flow Roadmap:

- Focuses on **decisions**, not deliverables  
- Prioritizes **systemic change**, not reactive fixes  
- Evolves through **learning loops**, not static plans

## 🧩 What makes a good flow decision?

Before adding a decision to the roadmap, ask:

- **What triggered it?**  
- **What flow outcome are we aiming to improve?**  
- **What kind of intervention is it?**  
- **How will we know it worked?**  

Then—and only then—ask:

---

## 📌 Where should it go on the roadmap?

Use the **Now / Next / Later** framework to place each FDR:

| Position | Description | Use it for… |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Now** | In progress or ready to implement | High-impact, high-feasibility decisions with low risk |
| **Next** | Planned or being shaped | Medium-risk decisions that need prep, alignment, or dependency resolution |
| **Later** | Valid options, not yet feasible or urgent | Exploratory decisions or ideas with unresolved constraints |

## 🧭 How to prioritize flow decisions

Balance these **three prioritization lenses**:

### 1. Impact

- How many people or teams will this decision affect?  
- Will it meaningfully improve delivery speed, clarity, or autonomy?  
- Is it likely to shift systemic flow outcomes, not just local pain?

✅ Focus on high-impact decisions that address persistent blockers or affect key capabilities.

---

### 2. Feasibility

- Is the decision achievable with current capacity or constraints?  
- Can it be piloted safely?  
- Are stakeholders aligned enough to proceed?

✅ Move forward with decisions that are within reach—and don’t require a 12-month reorg to get started.

---

### 3. Root Cause vs. Symptom

- Are we solving the **underlying flow issue**, or just treating side effects?  
- What other decisions depend on this one being made first?

✅ Prioritize decisions that unlock progress on other flow struggles.  
❗Avoid applying fixes to symptoms without first addressing upstream causes.

## 🔄 Flow roadmapping is iterative

1. **Apply** a decision  
2. **Reflect** after implementation  
3. **Adjust or add** follow-on decisions based on what you’ve learned

Each decision feeds the next:

> _“Now that we’ve split this team and reduced handoffs, we can simplify the platform interface they use.”_

---

## 🔗 Understand dependencies between decisions

- Some decisions are standalone. Others are sequenced.  
- Use arrows or swimlanes to show dependencies.  
- A platform change might depend on a team structure shift.  
- Reducing cognitive load might require clarifying ownership first.

---

## 💡 Tips for facilitating roadmap discussions

- Use sticky notes or cards per FDR  
- Group by theme (e.g., platform, ownership, coordination)  
- Ask: _“What’s blocking the next level of improvement?”_  
- Revisit the roadmap monthly or after major FDRs are implemented  
- Keep decisions visible—even if they're in “Later”
