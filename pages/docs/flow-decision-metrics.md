Use these metrics to evaluate the impact of flow decisions. They provide evidence to validate improvements in speed, quality, clarity, and cognitive load.

## 1. Speed & Responsiveness

- ⏱️ **Lead time**  
  Time from request (idea, ticket, user need) to delivery.

- 🔃 **Cycle time**  
  Time from when work starts to when it's completed.

- 📬 **Time to feedback**  
  Time from launch to receiving actionable user/system feedback.

- 📦 **Deployment frequency**  
  How often new code or changes are delivered to users.

## 2. Quality & Stability

- ⚠️ **Change failure rate**  
  Percentage of changes that fail or require rework.

- 🐞 **Bug/incident rate**  
  Volume or severity of production issues tied to recent changes.

- 🚨 **Escalation rate**  
  Frequency of internal escalations or support issues.

## 3. Efficiency & Flow Health

- 📋 **Work in Progress (WIP)**  
  Total active items or initiatives being worked on.

- ♻️ **Flow efficiency**  
  Percent of time work is actively progressing versus waiting.

- ➡️ **Handoff count**  
  Number of team transitions for a typical work item.

- ⏳ **Queue time / wait time**  
  Time work spends waiting between steps or approvals.

## 4. Clarity & Alignment

- ✅ **Team confidence score**  
  How confident the team feels in ownership and direction (typically survey-based).

- 🧭 **Alignment score**  
  How clearly work aligns to a strategic objective or user need.

- 🧾 **Clarity of ownership**  
  Number of issues tagged with ambiguous or dual ownership.

## 5. Cognitive Load

- 🧠 **Cognitive load self-assessment**  
  How overwhelmed teams feel (via internal survey).

- 🌐 **Responsibility breadth**  
  Number of distinct domains or services a team owns.

- 📞 **Support requests / interruptions**  
  Frequency of inbound interruptions from other teams.

Now that we've collected metrics, we can explore how to run a [Flow Clinic](/docs/flow-clinic) to bring this all together.
