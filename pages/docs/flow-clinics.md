## What is a Flow Clinic?

A Flow Clinic is a facilitated session where individuals or teams bring   flow-related challenges, trade-offs, or structural uncertainties for collaborative exploration. Rather than prescribing answers, Flow Clinics create a space for advice-based decision-making, guided by shared principles and facilitated inquiry.

It’s not a status meeting, a steering committee, or a re-org planning session. It’s a safe environment to stress-test ideas, gather diverse input, and increase the visibility and quality of flow decisions.

## Purpose of a Flow Clinic

Enable decentralized, transparent decision-making around flow.

- Minimize rework and misalignment caused by unclear ownership or siloed decisions
- Increase clarity and confidence in structural or interaction-based decisions
- Reduce delay in resolving team-level blockers to flow
- Maximize learning by sharing context across teams

## When to hold a Flow Clinic

Signals or triggers might include:

- “We’re not sure who should own this capability.”
- “This team is overloaded but we don’t know where to shift work.”
- “There’s friction between two teams trying to work on the same thing.”
- “We want to experiment with a new boundary but need feedback.”
- “A new constraint (tech, regulatory, strategic) has emerged and we need to adapt.”

## Who attends a Flow Clinic?

- The person/team bringing the flow challenge (the initiator)
- Facilitators (e.g. internal coaches, org designers, transformation leads)
- A diverse set of advisors—people with relevant context, affected roles, or adjacent perspectives
- Optional: Observers (for learning)

## Clinic structure (typical agenda – 30 to 60 min)

1. Welcome and framing (5 mins)

   - Purpose of the clinic
   - Norms: psychological safety, curiosity, advice process

2. Present the flow challenge (10 mins)

   - What’s the context?
   - What’s the decision or uncertainty?
   - What have you tried or considered?

3. Advice round (15–25 mins)

   - Advisors ask clarifying questions
   - Offer options, analogies, patterns, risks, or similar experiences
   - Facilitator may surface or sketch possible options using visual aids

4. Next steps (5–10 mins)

   - What decision(s) will the initiator make or explore further?
   - Record a draft Flow Decision Record (FDR)
   - Assign any follow-ups (if needed)

## Clinic outputs

- Draft or updated Flow Decision Record (FDR)
- Shared understanding of flow constraints or enablers
- Optionally visual models (sketches, capability maps, service interactions)

## Why it works

Flow Clinics are grounded in:

- Decentralized decision-making: empowering teams without creating chaos
- The advice process: distributing influence without diffusing responsibility
- Visual sense-making: using maps and models to uncover dynamics and options
- Social learning: enabling cross-pollination of insights across teams
