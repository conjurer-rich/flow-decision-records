Each FDR should aim to improve one or more of the following outcomes. These outcomes provide a shared language to reason about how changes improve the flow of value in the organization.

## Core Flow Outcomes

- 🔁 **Reduce handoffs**  
  Minimize the number of team-to-team transitions required to deliver value.

- ⚡ **Increase delivery speed**  
  Shorten the time from idea to value delivered. May include reducing lead time or cycle time.

- 🧠 **Reduce cognitive load**  
  Ensure teams can focus on what they’re responsible for without being overwhelmed by complexity.

- 🧭 **Clarify team responsibilities**  
  Improve clarity and ownership of domains, capabilities, or services.

- 🎯 **Align teams to user needs**  
  Restructure around real user needs or business capabilities, not internal silos.

  Increase the speed, frequency, and usefulness of feedback from users, customers, or systems.

- ⛓️ **Reduce coordination overhead**  
  Minimize synchronous planning, alignment, or negotiation across teams.

- 🧰 **Strengthen platform usability**  
  Improve the clarity, usability, or discoverability of internal platform services.

  Create space for testing changes without long approval cycles or fear of failure.

- 🚀 **Unblock strategic priorities**  
  Reshape structure to align with a new or evolving strategic initiative.
