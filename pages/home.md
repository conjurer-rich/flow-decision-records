  Supporting **decentralized, transparent decisions** that enable **faster flow of value**.

**Flow Decision Records (FDRs)** are short, structured documents used to capture key decisions made to improve the flow of value within an organization.

Inspired by Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), FDRs are lightweight, transparent, and grounded in context. They help organizations make better decisions—faster—by surfacing struggles, gathering advice, and recording how decisions impact flow over time.

## 🧭 Why Flow Decision Records?

Organizations are systems in motion—not static charts. Decisions about team structure, ownership, and platform boundaries shape how work flows (or gets blocked). But these decisions are often:

- Made in silos
- Driven by gut feel or fire-fighting
- Poorly documented
- Hard to evaluate later

FDRs fix that. They support:

- **Decentralized, informed decision-making**
- **Traceability of why decisions were made**
- **Learning loops based on real-world flow outcomes**

## 📄 What’s in an FDR?

Each record includes:

- The **trigger**: What prompted the decision (e.g., delivery delays, unclear ownership)
- The **decision**: What change is being proposed
- The **approach**: What kind of intervention is being used (e.g., split a team, simplify a platform)
- The **expected outcomes** and **flow metrics**: What success looks like
- The **advice process**: Who was consulted and why
- The **roadmap position**: Is this happening now, next, or later?
- The **evaluation plan**: How and when we’ll know it worked
