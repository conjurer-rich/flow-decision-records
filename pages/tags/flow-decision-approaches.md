These icons can help visually identify the type of intervention being made in a Flow Decision Record (FDR).

## A. Team Structure & Boundaries

- ✂️ **Split a team by value stream**  
  One team becomes two or more focused on distinct user needs or capabilities.

- 🔗 **Merge or recombine teams**  
  Combine teams to reduce handoffs or align better with a shared purpose.

- 🔄 **Dynamic reteaming**  
  Move individuals between teams to evolve boundaries or seed new capabilities.

- 🆘 **Create an enabling team**  
  Launch a new team to support others with specific capabilities or practices.

- 🎛️ **Redesign team responsibilities**  
  Change what a team owns to reduce cognitive load or improve autonomy.

## B. Interaction Design

- 🧭 **Redefine team interactions**  
  Clarify or reduce expected collaboration types (collaboration, X-as-a-Service, facilitating, etc.).

- 🔓 **Reduce or remove dependencies**  
  Decouple services, eliminate shared code, or shift to clear APIs.

- 🗣️ **Introduce an advice process**  
  Enable decentralized decisions by formalizing consultation over consensus.

- 🔁 **Strengthen feedback loops**  
  Add or redesign ways to learn from users, systems, or adjacent teams.

## C. Platform & Architecture

- 🧱 **Extract a shared capability into a platform service**  
  Move reusable capabilities into a dedicated platform team or service.

- 🧰 **Simplify or redesign platform interfaces**  
  Improve clarity and ease of use for internal platforms or services.

- 🛠️ **Introduce supporting tooling**  
  Add tools (dashboards, catalogs, scorecards) to improve visibility or alignment.

## D. Strategic & Governance Adjustments

- 🔀 **Shift prioritization model**  
  Change how work is sequenced or selected to improve alignment with flow goals.

- 📆 **Reshape cross-functional forums**  
  Update rituals or syncs (e.g., planning, architecture reviews) to reduce overload and improve focus.

- 📊 **Establish flow-focused metrics**  
  Create and align around metrics tied to delivery speed, feedback, or ownership clarity.
